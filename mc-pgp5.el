;; mc-pgp5.el, Support for PGP version 2.6.* in Mailcrypt
;;           (C) 1998  Len Budney <lbudney@pobox.com>

;; These functions have been added to Mailcrypt version 3.4, to
;; support PGP version 5.0.  They depend on the "expect.el" functions
;; kindly provided by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen <[22]lmi@gnus.org> to
;; interact with PGP, since batchmode support is sketchy or broken.

;; {{{ Modified mc-process-region uses "expect.el" to interact with PGP.
;; This is necessary because PGP5.0 is fairly broken in its batch
;; mode, and so *MUST* interact with the user under various error
;; conditions.
;;
;; More particularly, the old mailcrypt ran PGP in batch mode, then
;; exposed the results to a regexp-based parser.  This is not possible
;; with PGP5.0 or PGP5.0i, since pgp* does not exit in the case of
;; errors, but rather reprompts the user.  Our solution is to hand the
;; PROCESS off to a parser, which subsumes some of the functionality
;; which used to be in mc-process-region.
