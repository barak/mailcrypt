Mon Sep 28 01:09:16 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.info-1: Updated rmail
	documentation for Emacs 20.3, in which the rmail-mode-hook has
	changed to rmail-show-message-hook.  Thanks to Tim Steele.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.info-1,
	mailcrypt.info: Updated documentation to mention "message-mode"
	when setting up Mailcrypt for use under Gnus.  Thanks to
	several usenet posters addressing this problem, particularly
	Kevin Davidson.

	* mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Modified mc-pgp[50]-lookup-key to not
	mind a missing secret keyring.	This is useful for the paranoid
	sorts ;-) who keep their secret keyring on a floppy, and who
	usually encrypt to public keys but don't sign.	These folks can
	encrypt without their secret keyring even being on the machine
	in question.  Thanks to Steven T. Smith (usenet post, 1997/02/03).

Sun Sep 27 23:51:36 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp5.el: Applied patches which help Mailcrypt
	to run correctly with PGP 5.0i in XEmacs.  Thanks to Gunnar
	Evermann.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed the last bug in key snarfing; updated feedback
	to adhere to the current convention (list instead of cons).

Thu Sep 24 03:12:17 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Improved diagnostic messages, particularly
	for signatures.  They still don't quite match up with the old
	Mailcrypt messages, but they are a good deal better.

Wed Sep 23 21:31:15 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Encryption now handles the (bogus) case that no
	recipients are specified.  I believe that PGP 2.6.2 quietly armors
	text in that case, and perhaps we should do that.  At the moment,
	however, we trap the error condition.

	* mc-pgp5.el: There!  The last bug rooted out.	Now
	mc-pgp50-process-region works correctly with Brian Warner's
	key snarfing code.  Provisionally, key snarfing support is
	now complete.

	* mc-pgp5.el, mailcrypt.el, mc-gpg.el: Changed behavior of
	mc-pgp50-process-region to use more "Mailcryptish" messages.
	In part, this is to facilitate key fetching and snarfing, using
	code contributed by Brian Warner.  We're getting close!

Tue Sep 22 12:10:21 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Changed "distclean" target to remove derived file
	"gpgwrap.pl".

	* mc-pgp5.el, Attic/gpgwrap.pl, gpgwrap.pl.in, mc-gpg.el,
	Makefile.in, configure, configure.in: Changed gpgwrap.pl to an
	"autoconf" file so that the path to perl is set at configuration
	time.  Also added minor fixes to PGP 5.0 encryption.

	* mc-gpg.el: Oops again.  Missed mc-gpg.el this time.

	* Attic/gpgwrap.pl, README.gpg: Oops--added in contributed
	files from Brian Warner containing the guts of GPG support.
	The previous revision included only changes to existing files.
	All better now!

	* mc-toplev.el, Makefile.in, mailcrypt.el, mc-setversion.el,
	INSTALL: Added complete implementation of GnuPG support.  Also
	fixed up mc-setversion so that version selection behaves more
	like the documentation claims.	Documentation includes discussion
	of the new GnuPG support.  Much thanks to Brian Warner, again!

	* mc-pgp5.el: Implemented functional Key Snarfing under PGP 5.0.
	Thanks to Brian Warner!

	* mc-remail.el: Modified remailer support to handle multiple
	newsgroups correctly.  I'm having real trouble posting with
	Mixmaster remailers, so this is pretty experimental.

Tue Sep  1 03:14:22 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp.el: Updated MIT public keyserver address for PGP 2.6.x
	key lookup.  Thanks to Bill Wohler.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mc-remail.el: Updated finger address for
	remailer list in variable documentation.  Changed regexp for
	parsing Levien remailer list to account for single quotes,
	which are sometimes used.

Sat Aug 29 13:30:54 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-1,
	mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.dvi, Makefile.in, configure,
	configure.in: Updated Mailcrypt documentation--still a long way
	to go.	Also fixed up the installation of info files, so the
	new documentation will install correctly.

	* configure.in, configure: Fixed a bug in the configure script
	which got confused when emacs (or Xemacs) are referred to by
	their full pathname.  Thanks to Sergio Antoy.

Fri Aug 28 02:23:05 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Moved definition of
	mc-pgp-always-sign into mailcrypt.el so that it applies to all
	encryption schemes at once.  Also fixed a bug which prevented
	deactivation of an incorrect passphrase when signing and
	encrypting in one step.

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Fixed a bug in the
	RFC-822 regular expression for mail headers.  Also enhanced PGP
	keyid lookup to ignore revoked keys in both PGP 2 and PGP 5.
	Thanks to Dean Bullock for spotting this bug.

Thu Aug 27 22:09:44 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el: Modified mc-field-name-regexp to match on exactly
	those email headers which are RFC-822 compliant.

	* mailcrypt.el: Changed mc-field-name-regexp so that fields with
	":" in their bodies work correctly.  This permits addresses like
	"null:" and like "post: alt.test" when using mixmaster remailers.
	Note however that the latter should also be generated seamlessly
	by mailcrypt when posting in the usual way.

	* mc-toplev.el: Updated Gnus support to look in
	gnus-original-article-buffer rather than in gnus-article-buffer
	for PGP stuff.	Gnus has been changed to actually delete PGP
	stuff when using gnus-article-hide-pgp, and this patch permits
	verification of signatures even when hidden.  Thanks to Dave Love.

Wed Aug 26 00:32:28 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Changed mc-pgp50-always-sign back to mc-pgp-always-sign.  As a
	result, encrypting for remailers does not prompt repeatedly
	"Sign the message?"  As a side effect, "always sign" really
	means always; for every coding scheme.

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Fixed a stupid typo introduced in the previous revision.

Tue Aug 25 12:13:48 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Enabled signing and encrypting in one step.  Thanks to Fabien Coelho.

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Added public key insertion for PGP 5.0, and fixed the annoying
	lack of newlines at the and of PGP messages.  Thanks to Sergio Antoy.

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Added Mailcrypt comment to signed messages in PGP 5.0.

Sun Aug 23 23:41:17 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el, mc-setversion.el, mc-toplev.el, Attic/mc-pgp2.el,
	Makefile.in, mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, INSTALL: Completed a major
	rewrite.  Basic elisp code is unchanged, and overall functionality
	is unchanged.  However, I restored the original mailcrypt files
	to their prior condition (almost), and implemented PGP 5 support
	through the "scheme" mechanism originally provided by Pat and Jin.
	Though there are pros and cons to both their approach and mine,
	I would rather stick with theirs.  Now GPG support can be added
	fairly simply!

Wed Aug 19 22:24:50 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL:
	Changed setup info for .emacs file to load "mc-setversion" rather
	than autoloading it.  After all, it's silly to "autoload" something
	and then immediately call it!  Thanks to Aaron Gross and David
	Maslen.

	* configure: Generated updated configure script.

	* configure.in, INSTALL:
	Tweaked the EMACSFLAGS for Xemacs to work for both Xemacs 19.x
	and 20.x.  Fixed up the INSTALL file to document these slight
	differences.

Tue Aug 18 12:23:13 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in:
	Added "--vanilla" flag for Xemacs compiling, and modified the
	"configure" script to abort if emacs or Xemacs are not found.
	Also, changed the override to use the environment variable
	"EMACS" instead of the totally ridiculous "EMACS19".  Thanks to
	Amir J. Katz.

Wed Jul 29 01:13:04 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Attic/timer.el, FSF-timer.el, Makefile.in, configure, configure.in:
	Moved "timer.el" to a file of another name, to prevent inadvertantly
	including it when the timer package is already installed.

	* Attic/timer.el:
	Used a different version of timer.el which doesn't BREAK mailcrypt
	for NON xemacs users.

Sun Jul 26 11:40:01 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed "make dist" to include timer.el.  Oops!

Fri Jul 24 20:30:04 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS: Updated announcement and news files.

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old:
	Moved Jin and Pat's ChangeLog data into ChangeLog.old for the sake
	of history.  The Changelog file will be automatically generated from
	my sources from now on.

	* ONEWS, ChangeLog, NEWS:
	Updated news and changelog files for the anticipated flurry
	of development and bug fixes.

Thu Jul 23 02:37:55 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL, README:
	Updated documentation for Xemacs users, and deleted some (old, and
	apparently obsolete) pointers from the README file.

	* Attic/timer.el, configure.in, Makefile.in, configure:
	Added timer.el to the Mailcrypt distribution, so that Mailcrypt should
	work correctly for Xemacs users.  The configure script simply checks
	whether timer.el is in the user's load path, and includes timer.el in
	the list of files to compile and install if it isn't.

Wed Jul 22 02:20:49 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Modified mc-pgp5-sign-parser to behave correctly when signing 8bit
	data.  In that case, the PGP delimiter reads "END PGP MESSAGE"
	rather than "END PGP SIGNATURE".  Thanks to Greg Steuck.

Tue Jul 21 12:25:18 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* load-path.hack, Makefile.in:
	Made Makefile more conformant to GNU standards, and eliminated annoying
	warning about Emacs versions other than 19.*.  Thanks to Tony Silva.

	* mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info:
	Updated version number in elisp code.

	* Attic/pgpv.sh, Attic/pgpe.sh, Attic/pgps.sh, mc-setversion.el,
	Attic/mc-pgpk, mc-pgp5.el, mc-pgp.el, Makefile.in: Removed
	dependency on shell scripts and perl scripts.  Added completion
	to mc-setversion.  Thanks to Brian Warner.

	* mc-pgp5.el, INSTALL:
	Corrected initialization instructions and fixed regular expression to
	permit handling of emails in Svenska.  Thanks to Jonas Linde.
