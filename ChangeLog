Fri Jul 24 13:33:54 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* ONEWS, ChangeLog, NEWS: Updated news and changelog files for
	the anticipated flurry of development and bug fixes.

	* INSTALL, README: Updated documentation for Xemacs users, and
	deleted some (old, and apparently obsolete) pointers from the
	README file.

	* configure.in, timer.el, Makefile.in, configure: Added timer.el
	to the Mailcrypt distribution, so that Mailcrypt should work
	correctly for Xemacs users.  The configure script simply checks
	whether timer.el is in the user's load path, and includes timer.el
	in the list of files to compile and install if it isn't.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Modified mc-pgp5-sign-parser to behave correctly
	when signing 8bit data.  In that case, the PGP delimiter reads
	"END PGP MESSAGE" rather than "END PGP SIGNATURE".  Thanks to
	Greg Steuck.
