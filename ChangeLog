1998-11-26  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.info-2, mc-pgp5.el, mailcrypt.info:
	Incorporated and tested Brian W's changes to mc-pgp5.el. He
	localized a bunch of variables, cutting down on compiler
	warnings. Thanks!

	* configure.in, mailcrypt.texi, mc-gpg.el, Makefile.in,
	README.gpg, configure: Incorporated more fixes from Brian Warner
	to GPG support; cleaned up Makefile, removed Perl test from
	configure script, updated the README.gpg, and much much more.

	* README.gpg: Sync-ed with patch from Brian Warner against
	3.5b7. The change appears trivial only because his previous
	patch was faithfully applied way back when.

1998-10-19  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed bug in signing 8-bit data (including
	messages in most languages other than English!	Bad, Bad PGP 5!).
	Thanks to Greg Steuck.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.info-2,
	mailcrypt.info: Updated "mc-setversion" documentation in the
	Mailcrypt info file.  Thanks to Adam Beck.

1998-10-16  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* configure.in, gpgwrap.pl.in, mc-gpg.el, INSTALL, Makefile.in,
	README.gpg, configure: Updated GPG support to handle GPG 0.4.1,
	and improve various aspects of mc-gpg.el.  Most notably, the
	wrapper script gpgwrap.pl is now obsolete, and Mailcrypt users
	are heartily recommended to upgrade their GPG installation--it
	was a GPG bug which necessitated the wrapper script.  Thanks to
	Brian Warner, the Official Mailcrypt GPG Wizard.

	* mc-pgp.el: Re-enabled conventional decryption in PGP 2.6 mode.
	Thanks to Roger Williams for spotting this bug.

1998-10-15  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed "bindir" in the makefile, so that gpgwrap
	gets installed in the correct place.  Thanks to Markku Kolkka.

1998-10-05  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-toplev.el: Modified mc-mh-decrypt-message to optionally
	turn off backup of MH messages.  By default, backup is enabled
	(for backward compatibility).  Use this one with caution.

1998-10-04  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mc-pgp5.el, mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.info-1:
	Fixed a "buffer bug" in which decrypting under mh-e exits with
	an error and leaves the user in some random buffer (although
	decryption succeeds).  Basically, the PGP 5.0 parsers all
	call "pop-to-buffer" near the end, which screws up the buffer
	history list.  Why on earth was "pop-to-buffer" ever used in
	the first place?

1998-09-28  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL: Fixed INSTALL documentation of "mc-setversion".

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info,
	mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.dvi, mailcrypt.el, ChangeLog,
	LCD-entry, README, ANNOUNCE: Update for release.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.info-1: Updated rmail
	documentation for Emacs 20.3, in which the rmail-mode-hook has
	changed to rmail-show-message-hook.  Thanks to Tim Steele.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.info-1,
	mailcrypt.info: Updated documentation to mention "message-mode"
	when setting up Mailcrypt for use under Gnus.  Thanks to
	several usenet posters addressing this problem, particularly
	Kevin Davidson.

	* mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Modified mc-pgp[50]-lookup-key to not
	mind a missing secret keyring.	This is useful for the paranoid
	sorts ;-) who keep their secret keyring on a floppy, and who
	usually encrypt to public keys but don't sign.	These folks can
	encrypt without their secret keyring even being on the machine
	in question.  Thanks to Steven T. Smith (usenet post, 1997/02/03).

1998-09-27  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp5.el: Applied patches which help Mailcrypt
	to run correctly with PGP 5.0i in XEmacs.  Thanks to Gunnar
	Evermann.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed the last bug in key snarfing; updated feedback
	to adhere to the current convention (list instead of cons).

1998-09-24  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Improved diagnostic messages, particularly
	for signatures.  They still don't quite match up with the old
	Mailcrypt messages, but they are a good deal better.

1998-09-23  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Encryption now handles the (bogus) case that no
	recipients are specified.  I believe that PGP 2.6.2 quietly armors
	text in that case, and perhaps we should do that.  At the moment,
	however, we trap the error condition.

	* mc-pgp5.el: There!  The last bug rooted out.	Now
	mc-pgp50-process-region works correctly with Brian Warner's
	key snarfing code.  Provisionally, key snarfing support is
	now complete.

	* mc-pgp5.el, mailcrypt.el, mc-gpg.el: Changed behavior of
	mc-pgp50-process-region to use more "Mailcryptish" messages.
	In part, this is to facilitate key fetching and snarfing, using
	code contributed by Brian Warner.  We're getting close!

1998-09-22  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Changed "distclean" target to remove derived file
	"gpgwrap.pl".

	* mc-pgp5.el, gpgwrap.pl, gpgwrap.pl.in, mc-gpg.el, Makefile.in,
	configure, configure.in: Changed gpgwrap.pl to an "autoconf"
	file so that the path to perl is set at configuration time.
	Also added minor fixes to PGP 5.0 encryption.

	* mc-gpg.el: Oops again.  Missed mc-gpg.el this time.

	* README.gpg, gpgwrap.pl: Oops--added in contributed files from
	Brian Warner containing the guts of GPG support.  The previous
	revision included only changes to existing files.  All better now!

	* mc-toplev.el, Makefile.in, mailcrypt.el, mc-setversion.el,
	INSTALL: Added complete implementation of GnuPG support.  Also
	fixed up mc-setversion so that version selection behaves more
	like the documentation claims.	Documentation includes discussion
	of the new GnuPG support.  Much thanks to Brian Warner, again!

	* mc-pgp5.el: Implemented functional Key Snarfing under PGP 5.0.
	Thanks to Brian Warner!

	* mc-remail.el: Modified remailer support to handle multiple
	newsgroups correctly.  I'm having real trouble posting with
	Mixmaster remailers, so this is pretty experimental.

1998-09-01  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.info: Updated
	precompiled info files.

	* mc-pgp.el: Updated MIT public keyserver address for PGP 2.6.x
	key lookup.  Thanks to Bill Wohler.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mc-remail.el:
	Updated finger address for remailer list in variable documentation.
	Changed regexp for parsing Levien remailer list to account for single
	quotes, which are sometimes used.

1998-08-29  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-1,
	mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.dvi, Makefile.in, configure,
	configure.in: Updated Mailcrypt documentation--still a long way
	to go.	Also fixed up the installation of info files, so the
	new documentation will install correctly.

	* configure.in, configure: Fixed a bug in the configure script
	which got confused when emacs (or Xemacs) are referred to by
	their full pathname.  Thanks to Sergio Antoy.

1998-08-28  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Moved definition of
	mc-pgp-always-sign into mailcrypt.el so that it applies to all
	encryption schemes at once.  Also fixed a bug which prevented
	deactivation of an incorrect passphrase when signing and
	encrypting in one step.

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Fixed a bug in the
	RFC-822 regular expression for mail headers.  Also enhanced PGP
	keyid lookup to ignore revoked keys in both PGP 2 and PGP 5.
	Thanks to Dean Bullock for spotting this bug.

1998-08-27  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el: Modified mc-field-name-regexp to match on exactly
	those email headers which are RFC-822 compliant.

	* mailcrypt.el: Changed mc-field-name-regexp so that fields with
	":" in their bodies work correctly.  This permits addresses like
	"null:" and like "post: alt.test" when using mixmaster remailers.
	Note however that the latter should also be generated seamlessly
	by mailcrypt when posting in the usual way.

	* mc-toplev.el: Updated Gnus support to look in
	gnus-original-article-buffer rather than in gnus-article-buffer
	for PGP stuff.	Gnus has been changed to actually delete PGP
	stuff when using gnus-article-hide-pgp, and this patch permits
	verification of signatures even when hidden.  Thanks to Dave Love.

1998-08-26  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Changed mc-pgp50-always-sign back to
	mc-pgp-always-sign.  As a result, encrypting for remailers does
	not prompt repeatedly "Sign the message?"  As a side effect,
	"always sign" really means always; for every coding scheme.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed a stupid typo introduced in the previous
	revision.

1998-08-25  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Enabled signing and encrypting in one step.
	Thanks to Fabien Coelho.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Added public key insertion for PGP 5.0, and
	fixed the annoying lack of newlines at the and of PGP messages.
	Thanks to Sergio Antoy.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Added Mailcrypt comment to signed messages in
	PGP 5.0.

1998-08-23  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el, mc-setversion.el, mc-toplev.el, Makefile.in,
	mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp2.el, INSTALL: Completed a major
	rewrite.  Basic elisp code is unchanged, and overall functionality
	is unchanged.  However, I restored the original mailcrypt files
	to their prior condition (almost), and implemented PGP 5 support
	through the "scheme" mechanism originally provided by Pat and Jin.
	Though there are pros and cons to both their approach and mine,
	I would rather stick with theirs.  Now GPG support can be added
	fairly simply!

1998-08-19  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL: Changed setup info for .emacs file to load
	"mc-setversion" rather than autoloading it.  After all, it's
	silly to "autoload" something and then immediately call it!
	Thanks to Aaron Gross and David Maslen.

	* configure: Generated updated configure script.

	* configure.in, INSTALL: Tweaked the EMACSFLAGS for Xemacs to
	work for both Xemacs 19.x and 20.x.  Fixed up the INSTALL file
	to document these slight differences.

1998-08-18  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in: Added "--vanilla"
	flag for Xemacs compiling, and modified the "configure" script
	to abort if emacs or Xemacs are not found.  Also, changed the
	override to use the environment variable "EMACS" instead of the
	totally ridiculous "EMACS19".  Thanks to Amir J. Katz.

1998-07-29  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* FSF-timer.el, Makefile.in, configure, configure.in, timer.el:
	Moved "timer.el" to a file of another name, to prevent inadvertantly
	including it when the timer package is already installed.

	* timer.el:
	Used a different version of timer.el which doesn't BREAK mailcrypt
	for NON xemacs users.

1998-07-26  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed "make dist" to include timer.el.  Oops!

1998-07-24  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS: Updated announcement and news files.

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old:
	Moved Jin and Pat's ChangeLog data into ChangeLog.old for the sake
	of history.  The Changelog file will be automatically generated from
	my sources from now on.

	* ONEWS, ChangeLog, NEWS:
	Updated news and changelog files for the anticipated flurry
	of development and bug fixes.

1998-07-23  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL, README:
	Updated documentation for Xemacs users, and deleted some (old, and
	apparently obsolete) pointers from the README file.

	* configure.in, timer.el, Makefile.in, configure:
	Added timer.el to the Mailcrypt distribution, so that Mailcrypt should
	work correctly for Xemacs users.  The configure script simply checks
	whether timer.el is in the user's load path, and includes timer.el in
	the list of files to compile and install if it isn't.

1998-07-22  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Modified mc-pgp5-sign-parser to behave correctly when signing 8bit
	data.  In that case, the PGP delimiter reads "END PGP MESSAGE"
	rather than "END PGP SIGNATURE".  Thanks to Greg Steuck.

1998-07-21  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* load-path.hack, Makefile.in: Made Makefile more conformant
	to GNU standards, and eliminated annoying warning about Emacs
	versions other than 19.*.  Thanks to Tony Silva.

	* mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info:
	Updated version number in elisp code.

	* pgpv.sh, pgpe.sh, pgps.sh, mc-setversion.el, mc-pgp5.el,
	mc-pgpk, mc-pgp.el, Makefile.in: Removed dependency on shell
	scripts and perl scripts.  Added completion to mc-setversion.
	Thanks to Brian Warner.

	* mc-pgp5.el, INSTALL: Corrected initialization instructions and
	fixed regular expression to permit handling of emails in Svenska.
	Thanks to Jonas Linde.
