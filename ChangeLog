	* INSTALL, README:
	Updated documentation for Xemacs users, and deleted some (old, and
	apparently obsolete) pointers from the README file.

	* configure.in, timer.el, Makefile.in, configure:
	Added timer.el to the Mailcrypt distribution, so that Mailcrypt should
	work correctly for Xemacs users.  The configure script simply checks
	whether timer.el is in the user's load path, and includes timer.el in
	the list of files to compile and install if it isn't.

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Modified mc-pgp5-sign-parser to behave correctly when signing 8bit
	data.  In that case, the PGP delimiter reads "END PGP MESSAGE"
	rather than "END PGP SIGNATURE".  Thanks to Greg Steuck.

	* load-path.hack, Makefile.in:
	Made Makefile more conformant to GNU standards, and eliminated annoying
	warning about Emacs versions other than 19.*.  Thanks to Tony Silva.

	* mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info: Updated version number in elisp code.

	* Attic/pgpv.sh, Attic/pgpe.sh, Attic/pgps.sh, mc-setversion.el, Attic/mc-pgpk, mc-pgp5.el, mc-pgp.el, Makefile.in:
	Removed dependency on shell scripts and perl scripts.  Added completion
	to mc-setversion.  Thanks to Brian Warner.

	* mc-pgp5.el, INSTALL:
	Corrected initialization instructions and fixed regular expression to
	permit handling of emails in Svenska.  Thanks to Jonas Linde.
