Sat Aug 29 13:30:54 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-1,
	mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.dvi, Makefile.in, configure,
	configure.in: Updated Mailcrypt documentation--still a long way to
	go.  Also fixed up the installation of info files, so the new
	documentation will install correctly.

	* configure.in, configure: Fixed a bug in the configure script
	which got confused when emacs (or Xemacs) are referred to by their
	full pathname.  Thanks to Sergio Antoy.

Fri Aug 28 02:23:05 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Moved definition of
	mc-pgp-always-sign into mailcrypt.el so that it applies to all
	encryption schemes at once.  Also fixed a bug which prevented
	deactivation of an incorrect passphrase when signing and
	encrypting in one step.

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Fixed a bug in the RFC-822
	regular expression for mail headers.  Also enhanced PGP keyid
	lookup to ignore revoked keys in both PGP 2 and PGP 5.  Thanks to
	Dean Bullock for spotting this bug.

Thu Aug 27 22:09:44 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el: Modified mc-field-name-regexp to match on exactly
	those email headers which are RFC-822 compliant.

	* mailcrypt.el: Changed mc-field-name-regexp so that fields with
	":" in their bodies work correctly.  This permits addresses like
	"null:" and like "post: alt.test" when using mixmaster remailers.
	Note however that the latter should also be generated seamlessly
	by mailcrypt when posting in the usual way.

	* mc-toplev.el: Updated Gnus support to look in
	gnus-original-article-buffer rather than in gnus-article-buffer
	for PGP stuff.  Gnus has been changed to actually delete PGP stuff
	when using gnus-article-hide-pgp, and this patch permits
	verification of signatures even when hidden.  Thanks to Dave Love.

Wed Aug 26 00:32:28 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Changed mc-pgp50-always-sign back to
	mc-pgp-always-sign.  As a result, encrypting for remailers does
	not prompt repeatedly "Sign the message?"  As a side effect,
	"always sign" really means always; for every coding scheme.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed a stupid typo introduced in the previous
	revision.

Tue Aug 25 12:13:48 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Enabled signing and encrypting in one step.  Thanks
	to Fabien Coelho.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Added public key insertion for PGP 5.0, and fixed
	the annoying lack of newlines at the and of PGP messages.  Thanks
	to Sergio Antoy.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Added Mailcrypt comment to signed messages in PGP
	5.0.

Sun Aug 23 23:41:17 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el, mc-setversion.el, mc-toplev.el, Attic/mc-pgp2.el,
	Makefile.in, mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, INSTALL: Completed a major
	rewrite.  Basic elisp code is unchanged, and overall functionality
	is unchanged.  However, I restored the original mailcrypt files to
	their prior condition (almost), and implemented PGP 5 support
	through the "scheme" mechanism originally provided by Pat and Jin.
	Though there are pros and cons to both their approach and mine, I
	would rather stick with theirs.  Now GPG support can be added
	fairly simply!

Wed Aug 19 22:24:50 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL: Changed setup info for .emacs file to load
	"mc-setversion" rather than autoloading it.  After all, it's silly
	to "autoload" something and then immediately call it!  Thanks to
	Aaron Gross and David Maslen.

	* configure: Generated updated configure script.

	* configure.in, INSTALL: Tweaked the EMACSFLAGS for Xemacs to work
	for both Xemacs 19.x and 20.x.  Fixed up the INSTALL file to
	document these slight differences.

Tue Aug 18 12:23:13 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in: Added "--vanilla" flag for
	Xemacs compiling, and modified the "configure" script to abort if
	emacs or Xemacs are not found.  Also, changed the override to use
	the environment variable "EMACS" instead of the totally ridiculous
	"EMACS19".  Thanks to Amir J. Katz.

Wed Jul 29 01:13:04 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Attic/timer.el, FSF-timer.el, Makefile.in, configure,
	configure.in: Moved "timer.el" to a file of another name, to
	prevent inadvertantly including it when the timer package is
	already installed.

	* Attic/timer.el: Used a different version of timer.el which
	doesn't BREAK mailcrypt for NON xemacs users.

Sun Jul 26 11:40:01 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed "make dist" to include timer.el.  Oops!

Fri Jul 24 20:30:04 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS: Updated announcement and news files.

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old: Moved Jin and Pat's ChangeLog data
	into ChangeLog.old for the sake of history.  The Changelog file
	will be automatically generated from my sources from now on.

	* ONEWS, ChangeLog, NEWS: Updated news and changelog files for the
	anticipated flurry of development and bug fixes.

Thu Jul 23 02:37:55 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL, README: Updated documentation for Xemacs users, and
	deleted some (old, and apparently obsolete) pointers from the
	README file.

	* Attic/timer.el, configure.in, Makefile.in, configure: Added
	timer.el to the Mailcrypt distribution, so that Mailcrypt should
	work correctly for Xemacs users.  The configure script simply
	checks whether timer.el is in the user's load path, and includes
	timer.el in the list of files to compile and install if it isn't.

Wed Jul 22 02:20:49 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Modified mc-pgp5-sign-parser to behave correctly
	when signing 8bit data.  In that case, the PGP delimiter reads
	"END PGP MESSAGE" rather than "END PGP SIGNATURE".  Thanks to Greg
	Steuck.

Tue Jul 21 12:25:18 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* load-path.hack, Makefile.in: Made Makefile more conformant to
	GNU standards, and eliminated annoying warning about Emacs
	versions other than 19.*.  Thanks to Tony Silva.

	* mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info: Updated version number in elisp
	code.

	* Attic/pgpv.sh, Attic/pgpe.sh, Attic/pgps.sh, mc-setversion.el,
	Attic/mc-pgpk, mc-pgp5.el, mc-pgp.el, Makefile.in: Removed
	dependency on shell scripts and perl scripts.  Added completion to
	mc-setversion.  Thanks to Brian Warner.

	* mc-pgp5.el, INSTALL: Corrected initialization instructions and
	fixed regular expression to permit handling of emails in Svenska.
	Thanks to Jonas Linde.

	* Attic/mc-pgpk, Attic/pgpe.sh, Attic/pgps.sh, Attic/pgpv.sh,
	mailcrypt.dvi, mailcrypt.texi, mkinstalldirs, texi2html.ext:
	Initial revision

	* Attic/mc-pgpk, Attic/pgpe.sh, Attic/pgps.sh, Attic/pgpv.sh,
	mailcrypt.dvi, mailcrypt.texi, mkinstalldirs, texi2html.ext:
	Initial revision.

	* ANNOUNCE, Attic/mc-pgp2.el, ChangeLog, INSTALL, LCD-entry,
	Makefile.in, NEWS, ONEWS, README, configure, configure.in,
	expect.el, install-sh, load-path.hack, mailcrypt.el,
	mailcrypt.info, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el, mc-remail.el,
	mc-setversion.el, mc-toplev.el: Initial revision
