	* mc-pgp5.el, mc-setversion.el, mc-toplev.el, Attic/mc-pgp2.el, Makefile.in, mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, INSTALL:
	Completed a major rewrite.  Basic elisp code is unchanged, and
	overall functionality is unchanged.  However, I restored the
	original mailcrypt files to their prior condition (almost), and
	implemented PGP 5 support through the "scheme" mechanism
	originally provided by Pat and Jin.  Though there are pros and
	cons to both their approach and mine, I would rather stick with
	theirs.  Now GPG support can be added fairly simply!

	* INSTALL:
	Changed setup info for .emacs file to load "mc-setversion" rather
	than autoloading it.  After all, it's silly to "autoload"
	something and then immediately call it!  Thanks to Aaron Gross and
	David Maslen.

	* configure: Generated updated configure script.

	* configure.in, INSTALL:
	Tweaked the EMACSFLAGS for Xemacs to work for both Xemacs 19.x and
	20.x.  Fixed up the INSTALL file to document these slight
	differences.

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in:
	Added "--vanilla" flag for Xemacs compiling, and modified the
	"configure" script to abort if emacs or Xemacs are not found.
	Also, changed the override to use the environment variable "EMACS"
	instead of the totally ridiculous "EMACS19".  Thanks to Amir
	J. Katz.

	* Attic/timer.el, FSF-timer.el, Makefile.in, configure, configure.in:
	Moved "timer.el" to a file of another name, to prevent
	inadvertantly including it when the timer package is already
	installed.

	* Attic/timer.el:
	Used a different version of timer.el which doesn't BREAK mailcrypt
	for NON xemacs users.

	* Makefile.in: Fixed "make dist" to include timer.el.  Oops!

Fri Jul 24 20:30:04 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS: Updated announcement and news files.

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old:
	Moved Jin and Pat's ChangeLog data into ChangeLog.old for the sake
	of history.  The Changelog file will be automatically generated
	from my sources from now on.

	* ONEWS, ChangeLog, NEWS:
	Updated news and changelog files for the anticipated flurry of
	development and bug fixes.

Thu Jul 23 02:37:55 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL, README:
	Updated documentation for Xemacs users, and deleted some (old, and
	apparently obsolete) pointers from the README file.

	* Attic/timer.el, configure.in, Makefile.in, configure:
	Added timer.el to the Mailcrypt distribution, so that Mailcrypt
	should work correctly for Xemacs users.  The configure script
	simply checks whether timer.el is in the user's load path, and
	includes timer.el in the list of files to compile and install if
	it isn't.

Wed Jul 22 02:20:49 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el:
	Modified mc-pgp5-sign-parser to behave correctly when signing 8bit
	data.  In that case, the PGP delimiter reads "END PGP MESSAGE"
	rather than "END PGP SIGNATURE".  Thanks to Greg Steuck.

Tue Jul 21 12:25:18 1998  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* load-path.hack, Makefile.in:
	Made Makefile more conformant to GNU standards, and eliminated
	annoying warning about Emacs versions other than 19.*.  Thanks to
	Tony Silva.

	* mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info:
	Updated version number in elisp code.

	* Attic/pgpv.sh, Attic/pgpe.sh, Attic/pgps.sh, mc-setversion.el, Attic/mc-pgpk, mc-pgp5.el, mc-pgp.el, Makefile.in:
	Removed dependency on shell scripts and perl scripts.  Added
	completion to mc-setversion.  Thanks to Brian Warner.

	* mc-pgp5.el, INSTALL:
	Corrected initialization instructions and fixed regular expression
	to permit handling of emails in Svenska.  Thanks to Jonas Linde.
