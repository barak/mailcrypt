Title: Mailcrypt: An Emacs interface to the GNU Privacy Guard and anonymous remailers.
Author: Patrick J. LoPresti, Leonard R. Budney, Brian Warner
Abstract: Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple but
 powerful interface to cryptographic functions for mail and news.
 .
 With Mailcrypt, encryption becomes a seamlessly integrated part of your mail
 and news handling environment.  Mailcrypt can automatically fetch public keys
 to encode, decode, and verify messages, and can be configured to automate
 mailing through anonymous remailers.
 .
 Although Mailcrypt may be used to process data in arbitrary Emacs buffers, it
 is most useful in conjunction with other Emacs packages for handling mail and
 news.  Mailcrypt has specialized support for Rmail, VM, MH-E, Mew, and Gnus.
