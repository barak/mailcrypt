The Debian Package mailcrypt
----------------------------


Loading Mailcrypt
=================

Users will need to put "(require 'mailcrypt-init)" in their "~/.emacs" to load
Mailcrypt, unless the local system administrator chose to start it by default.

System Administrators wanting to start Mailcrypt by default on their site
should answer accordingly at the appropriate configuration time question
(and may issue "dpkg-reconfigure <:=$PACKAGE:>" in case they changed their
minds afterwards).


Online Documentation
====================

Online documentation may be found in the info or HTML manual.

TeXInfo sources may be found in "<:=if($_="$doc/$PACKAGE.texi.gz")=~tr|/|/|s:>".
