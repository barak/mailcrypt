Default: true
_Description: Should Mailcrypt be auto-loaded by default at your site?
 Mailcrypt will globally (i.e., for all users on this site) overload certain
 Emacs functions and key-bindings if you answer affirmatively to this
 question.
 .
 This is generally a good thing, since Mailcrypt is a very useful package;
 however you may not want it to happen, and instead let single users at your
 site decide by themselves if they should load this package.
 .
 If you answer negatively, people who desire to use it will have to put the
 string "(require 'mailcrypt-init)" in their personal Emacs configuration
 file (e.g., "~/.emacs" or "~/.emacs.el") to load it.
