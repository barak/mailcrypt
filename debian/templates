_Description: Should Mailcrypt be auto-loaded by default at your site?
 Mailcrypt will globally (i.e., for all users on this site) overload certain
 Emacs functions and key-bindings if you answer yes to this question.
 .
 This is generally a good thing, since Mailcrypt is a very useful package;
 however you may not want it to happen, and instead let single users at your
 site decide by themselves if they should load this package.
 .
 If you answer no, people who desire to use it will have to put the string
 "(require 'mailcrypt-init)" in their "~/.emacs" to load it.

Template: mailcrypt/alreadydefault
Type: note
_Description: Mailcrypt seems to be already auto-loaded at your site.  Good.
 By inspection of the file "/etc/site-start.el" Mailcrypt seems to be
 already auto-loaded by default at your site.
 .
 If this is not true, or if it's not what you want, please search that file
 looking for "(require 'mailcrypt-init)" resembling forms and fix it; then
 run "dpkg-reconfigure mailcrypt" if needed (recommended).
