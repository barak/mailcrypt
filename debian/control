Description: An Emacs interface to the GNU Privacy Guard
 Mailcrypt is an Emacs lisp package that provides a simple but
 powerful interface to cryptographic functions for mail and news.  With
 Mailcrypt, encryption becomes a seamlessly integrated part of your mail
 and news handling environment.  Mailcrypt can automatically fetch
 public keys to encode, decode, and verify messages, and can be configured
 to automate mailing through anonymous remailers.
 .
 Although Mailcrypt may be used to process data in arbitrary Emacs
 buffers, it is most useful in conjunction with other Emacs packages for
 handling mail and news.  Mailcrypt has specialized support for Rmail,
 VM, MH-E, Mew, and Gnus.
 .
 Currently XEmacs ships with its own Mailcrypt, so this package should
 only be used with GNU/Emacs.  (I.e., you don't need to install this
 package if your site uses only XEmacs.)
