  # Version 3.5.4-5, 3.5.5-1, 3.5.5-2, 3.5.5-3, 3.5.5-4, and 3.5.5-5 of
  # mailcrypt had a typo bug and failed to remove $ELCLOG.gz.

  # The affected time window is from 1999-10-12 to 1999-12-12, when the emacs19
  # Debian version was 19.34-21 while the emacs20 ones were 20.3-11--20.4-3.

  # However, other emacsen may have been used as well, so our strategy is to
  # remove $ELCLOG.gz and its parents, if empty, from every no more installed
  # emacsen directory.

  # Of course package, files, and directories names are hardcoded here, as this
  # is code that deals with old cruft, and should not change in the future with
  # "variables" or "system.variables".
