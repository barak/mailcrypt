Noteworthy changes in Mailcrypt version 3.5b4:

 * Fixed a bug which broke encryption to multiple recipients (PGP 5).

 * Fixed a bug which broke encryption of 8-bit data and files (PGP 5).

 * Fixed the missing "timer.el" problem.  Now Mailcrypt should run
   properly for Xemacs users.

 * Eliminated some silly shell and perl scripts.

 * Updated the README to reduce installation difficulties (I hope).



Noteworthy changes in Mailcrypt version 3.5b1:

 * No bug fixes; in fact there are probably fresh new bugs.

 * Mailcrypt now supports PGP version 5.0 as well as version 2.6.*, and
   can be toggled between "active versions" at will.  Every effort has
   been made to ensure that what used to work, still works.
