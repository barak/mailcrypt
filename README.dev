Developers' Notes:

I've added the beginnings of a unit test framework to MailCrypt. The only
thing tested so far is GPG decryption. The armored keyrings and test cases
are packaged as part of the distribution tarball, where a 'make check' can
unpack them and then use them to run the tests. There are two keyrings: a
full set (used to create the test cases), and an 'exported' set which has
some of the secret keys removed (to test what happens when you try to
decrypt a message that isn't addressed to you).

To build MailCrypt from CVS:

You will need GNU autoconf. The following sequence will create the
distribution tarball.

   autoconf
   ./configure
   make dist

To rebuild the unit test keyrings and test cases:

You will need the Python GnuPGInterface module, available at
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-gnupg/>. It is used to automate the
creation of the test messages. After installing it, do the following to
create the keys:

 ./configure
 cd tests/gpg-keys
  make new-rings
   (now manually sign the appropriate keys following the hints emitted by
    the script.. this part hasn't been automated yet)
  make exported
  make pack
   (creates allrings.txt, the armored keyring file. This file is checked into
    CVS)
 cd ..
 make gpg-testcases
  (this unpacks allrings.txt, then runs a program which creates the GPG test
   cases in gpg-testcases/* . These test cases are also checked into CVS)
