Mailcrypt version 3.5b1 is now available.

Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
to message encryption with PGP.  (You do use Emacs to handle your mail
and news, right?)

New Features: Encryption, decryption and signing may be done using
either PGP versions 2.6.* and 5.0.  Be aware that the PGP5.0 support
is a fairly primitive beta layered on top of Patrick's and Jin's
EXCELLENT package.  If anything breaks, including things that used to
work, you get to keep both pieces.  More seriously, defects should be
considered my fault, and for as long as I am up to the task I will
take bug reports and try to improve things.

Old Features: Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting
keys, passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
(including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.

*We* think it's the best interface to these functions anywhere, but
then again, we're biased.
