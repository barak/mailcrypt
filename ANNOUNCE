  Mailcrypt 3.5.7 is Available for Download


  1.  Introduction

  Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
  to message encryption with PGP (you do use Emacs to handle your mail
  and news, right?).  The current version of Mailcrypt handles PGP 2.6.x,
  PGP 5.x, and GnuPG 1.x .


  2.  Features

  2.1. New in this Release

  This release contains hooks to make Mailcrypt usable in Mew summary,
  draft, and message buffers (note that Mew handles RFC3156-style PGP/MIME
  messages by itself; mailcrypt support is just for traditional 'inline'
  encryption).

  A few bugs were fixed. MH support was changed to work with the latest
  release of mh-e. Gnus support was updated to be usable in the summary
  buffer. Mailcrypt no longer hard-wires /tmp as a temporary directory, but
  uses an emacs variable called temporary-file-directory instead, which might
  work better on NT.


  2.2.	Stable Features for PGP 5.0 and GnuPG

  Support for GnuPG.  Key fetching/snarfing functionality for PGP 5.0.
  Messages from PGP 5.0 operations now resemble more closely the
  messages generated for version 2.6.  Encryption works correctly,
  even when the secret keyring is not available (a requested feature
  for paranoid types ;-).  Mixmaster and Cypherpunk remailers can be
  used in PGP 5.0 mode, if the user has an RSA key. Further updated
  documentation for support under various mail packages.


  2.3.	Features for PGP 2.6.x (stable)

  Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting keys,
  passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
  support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
  (including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
  support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.


  2.4.	Still To Do

  o  Fix signing of foreign-language emails under GNUS/Mule. Currently,
     foreign characters are preceded by a '\207' byte, which is
     present at signing, but stripped when messages are sent.

  o  Get Mailcrypt to work with PGP 5.0 on NT.

  o  Test Mailcrypt against PGP 6.5.

  o  Refine Mailcrypt schemes so that alternate backends, like Crypt++,
     can be used.

  o  Expand self-test framework.
