  Mailcrypt 3.5b5 is Available for Download


  1.  Introduction


  Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
  to message encryption with PGP (you do use Emacs to handle your mail
  and news, right?). Mailcrypt version 3.5b1 and higher have been
  extended to handle both PGP 2.6.x and PGP 5.x.

  2.  Features


  2.1.	New Features in This Release


  Major rewrite of Emacs lisp code. Support for PGP 2.6.x has been
  restored to its orignal condition, hopefully adding to its stability.
  The original "schemes" mechanism is now in use for PGP 5.x, which
  should facilitate adding of GPG and other schemes in the future.
  Documentation and installation have been cleaned up a great deal.

  2.2.	Features for PGP 2.6.x (stable)


  Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting keys,
  passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
  support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
  (including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
  support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.

  2.3.	Still To Do


  o  Add key snarfing support for PGP 5.x.

  o  Enable signing/encrypting in one step.

  o  Add GPG support.

  o  Restore functionality on Windows 95/98/NT. If tiny-pgp can do it,
     we can too!
