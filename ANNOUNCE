  Mailcrypt 3.5.3 is Available for Download


  1.  Introduction


  Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
  to message encryption with PGP (you do use Emacs to handle your mail
  and news, right?). Mailcrypt version 3.5b1 and higher have been
  extended to handle both PGP 2.6.x and PGP 5.x.  Versions 3.5 and
  higher, including 3.5.3, also support encryption with GnuPG. Thanks
  to Brian Warner.


  2.  Features

  2.1. New Features/Enhancements

   We have key fetching for PGP 5.0! Paul Koning has added support for
   the Horowitz Key Protocol! PGP 5 keyservers can now be queried. If
   no bugs are exposed in this release, then Mailcrypt's PGP5 support
   can be considered feature-complete.

   Improved compatibility for XEmacs users! We've fixed up several
   gotchas which prevented version 3.5.1 from working "out of the box"
   with XEmacs. Cross your fingers...it should be just fine now.

   Fixed a minor compatibility bug with GPG support and GPG verson
   0.9.3. Fixed a bug which dumped GNUS users into the wrong buffer after
   verifying a signature. Fixed a compatibility bug between XEmacs and FSF
   Emacs in mc-setversion. Fixed a bug in mh-e support so that users can
   view decrypted messages without saving them. Several minor bugfixes.


  2.2.	Stable Features for PGP 5.0 and GnuPG

  Support for GnuPG.  Key snarfing functionality for PGP 5.0.
  Messages from PGP 5.0 operations now resemble more closely the
  messages generated for version 2.6.  Encryption works correctly,
  even when the secret keyring is not available (a requested feature
  for paranoid types ;-).  Mixmaster and Cypherpunk remailers can be
  used in PGP 5.0 mode, if the user has an RSA key. Further updated
  documentation for support under various mail packages.


  2.3.	Features for PGP 2.6.x (stable)

  Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting keys,
  passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
  support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
  (including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
  support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.


  2.4.	Still To Do

  o  Restore functionality on Windows 95/98/NT. If tiny-pgp can do it,
     we can too!

  o  Refine Mailcrypt schemes so that alternate backends, like Crypt++,
     can be used.
