  Mailcrypt 3.5b6 is Available for Download


  1.  Introduction


  Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
  to message encryption with PGP (you do use Emacs to handle your mail
  and news, right?). Mailcrypt version 3.5b1 and higher have been
  extended to handle both PGP 2.6.x and PGP 5.x.

  2.  Features


  2.1.	New Features in This Release

  Sign/encrypt in one step is enabled for PGP 5.  Insertion of public
  keys now works for PGP 5.  Mailcrypt now ignores revoked keys in the
  user's keyring.  Email-header-detection is now RFC822 compliant and
  won't choke on headers containing colons.  Signature verification
  works for usenet postings in GNUS even with gnus-hide-pgp activated.
  The "Processed by Mailcrypt" self-promotion comment is back for both
  versions of PGP.  Configuration scripts are smarter, and many other
  bugs have been fixed.  Remailer support has been tested for PGP 5.

  2.2.	Features for PGP 2.6.x (stable)

  Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting keys,
  passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
  support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
  (including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
  support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.

  2.3.	Still To Do


  o  Add key snarfing support for PGP 5.x.

  o  Add GPG support.

  o  Restore functionality on Windows 95/98/NT. If tiny-pgp can do it,
     we can too!
