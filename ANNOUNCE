  Mailcrypt 3.5b7 is Available for Download


  1.  Introduction


  Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
  to message encryption with PGP (you do use Emacs to handle your mail
  and news, right?). Mailcrypt version 3.5b1 and higher have been
  extended to handle both PGP 2.6.x and PGP 5.x.  Starting with Beta 7
  Mailcrypt also supports encryption with GnuPG.


  2.  Features


  2.1.	New Features in This Release

  Support for GnuPG encryption has been added.  Key snarfing
  functionality for PGP 5.0 is working correctly now.  Messages from
  PGP 5.0 operations now resemble more closely the messages generated
  for version 2.6.  Encryption works correctly, even when the secret
  keyring is not available (a requested feature for paranoid types ;-).
  Further updated documentation for support under various mail packages.
  Lots of bug fixes.


  2.2.	Features for PGP 2.6.x (stable)

  Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting keys,
  passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
  support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
  (including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
  support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.


  2.3.	Still To Do

  o  Add key fetching support for PGP 5.x.

  o  Restore functionality on Windows 95/98/NT. If tiny-pgp can do it,
     we can too!
